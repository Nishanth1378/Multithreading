# üßµ Multithreaded Algorithms in Python

This repository showcases three Python programs using multithreading and concurrency to improve performance in:

- ‚úÖ Merge Sort  
- ‚úÖ Quick Sort  
- ‚úÖ File Downloading

Each program includes both single-threaded and multithreaded versions to allow side-by-side performance comparisons.

## üìÇ Project Structure

| File                           | Description                                                        |
|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `multithreaded_merge_sort.py`  | Multi-threaded Merge Sort implementation with performance comparison |
| `multithreaded_quick_sort.py`  | Quick Sort using ThreadPoolExecutor and depth control              |
| `multithreaded_file_download.py` | Concurrent vs sequential file downloader using threading in Google Colab |

## üß™ Features

### üß¨ Multithreaded Merge Sort

- Divides an array into sublists.  
- Sorts each sublist in parallel using threads.  
- Merges sorted sublists sequentially.  
- Shows time difference between single-threaded and multi-threaded sorting.

### ‚ö° Multithreaded Quick Sort

- Uses `ThreadPoolExecutor` with recursion depth control to parallelize sorting.  
- Compares performance with traditional single-threaded quicksort.  
- Includes performance benchmarking for array sizes up to 1 million.

### üåê File Downloader with Threading

- Downloads multiple files either sequentially or concurrently using `threading.Thread`.  
- Accepts URLs via manual input or uploaded `.txt` file.  
- Compares download times and demonstrates multithreaded speedup.  
- Compatible with Google Colab and uses `google.colab.files` for file uploads/downloads.

## üöÄ How to Run

### üîß Prerequisites

- Python 3.x  
- (Optional) Run in Google Colab for file downloader
